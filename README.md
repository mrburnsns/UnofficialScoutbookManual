# UnofficialScoutbookManual
The Unofficial Guide to Scoutbook for Parents and Leaders

This is a project designed to produce documentation for the Scoutbook website (www.scoutbook.com)used to track advancement in BSA packs and troops.  

It is not officially supported by Scoutbook, and I have no relation to Scoutbook other than as a user.  Any trademarks, designs or images are the property of Scoutbook.

The manual may be reproduced, distributed, modified by any Scouting organization, with credit under the GNU 3.0 license. 

Any suggestions, comments or revisions are welcome.

Happy Scouting!
